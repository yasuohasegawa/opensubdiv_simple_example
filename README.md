# opensubdiv_simple_example
Pixar tutorial code just tells us only prints out result of vertices and faces.
But I wanted to know how it looks, so I added GLFW code to draw results and visualize.

This code only works on xcode. You have to install opensubdiv, GLFW and glm with cmake.

Requierements:
・opensubdiv
・GLFW
・glm

TODO:
Load modeling things with assimp or own loader.
